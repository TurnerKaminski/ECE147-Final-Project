EOG and Ocular Artifacts in EEG measurements:

Although in the ideal case what the EEG measures will just be brain activity, this is not the case. Many biological/physiological 
phenomenon lead to EEG 'artifacts' aka signals that show up in the EEG but do not reflect what we are actually trying to measure. 
According to this Paper 1, ocular (eye) and myographic (muscle) artifacts are generally the most prominent ones in EEG measurements.
Thus, accurate prediction using EEG data must somehow be able to separate the signals encoding underlying brain activity and those
encoding other physiological artifacts.

In this particular dataset, they made EOG (Electrooculography) recordings in addition to EEG (Electroencephalogram) recordings.
EOG is also an electrical based physiological measurement, in particular of the eye. There is a permanent potential difference
on the order of 10s of millivolts between the back of the eye where the optic nerve connects and the cornea on the surface of
the eyeball which creates a corresponding electric field. This field is not constant but bends in different directions along 
with movements of the eye as conductive tissue in and around the eye influence the field. By making separate EOG measurements,
the authors of this experiment hope that classification methods could make use of the EOG measurements to characterize and
remove/reduce signal artifacts based on the human eye. In our particular project, the 3 channels containing EOG measurements were 
ignored due to a lack of field expertise to effectively utilize this data. Thus, the data we are working with will be the raw 
data containing all artifacts without post processing. Models we use to classify the data must then be able to deal with these
artifacts.
