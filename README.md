# ECE147-Final-Project

This is the code base for our final project for the ECE C147 neural nets and deep learning course at UCLA

The data used for training and testing the models is not publicly available, otherwise everything else is supplied.

Guide:

**Main Code**

This folder holds the 3 main files for this project, trainer.py is the training and evaluation functions, models.py is where we define models, and main.ipynb is the main notebook in which you can find our training.

**Experimental Notebooks**

This folder just holds python notebooks that were used for gathering more specific data as to not clog up the main notebook

**model_data**

This folder is where we stored all the data for the project except for the data sets that are not public. This includes our best models, screenshots of plots, etc.

**Thoughts**

This folder just holds text files holding some thoughts and questions for each other as we worked through this project.
