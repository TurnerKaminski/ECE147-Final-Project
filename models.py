# This is the file in which we will define our models

# Importing
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Here we define a seperate class for each model
## TO DO:

# it will be something like this once we start defining models:

# class $modeltype$(nn.Module):
#     def __init__(self, inputsize, outputsize, hiddensize):
#         define the layers/convolutions
#     def forward(self, x):
#         calc forward passes
